# FULL SHADERS FOR BLOXD

Please don't ban :)

This shader is extracted using a tool developed using an AI and I have not ill intentions to distribute the tool anytime soon.

With the help of an anonymous player (which I would not name), we tested how changing this shaders affect Bloxd, and we found that these shaders indeed can toggle on and off certain features for some blocks, like the reflection of "the sun" on the surface on iron ladders.

However, the tool is vibe coded, so the formatting is off and may contain erronous shader logic/syntax, make sure you know what you are doing.


I think user should have the liberty to disable shadows and some rendering toggles (especially clearcoat and sheen) for the final composition, since these may put load onto GPU and if the user's GPU does not fit the current SOTA, these may introduce frame drops, etc.
